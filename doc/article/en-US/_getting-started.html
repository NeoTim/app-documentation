        Before we start writing some code, you're going to want to grab one of our pre-configured, getting-started packages. We've got two versions available to you: one uses ECMAScript 2016 (JavaScript vNext) and the other one uses TypeScript. Choose one now by clicking one of the buttons below.

        //insert download buttons here

        Based on your selection, you'll want to configure this documentation to show the appropriate language for all samples. Look in the upper-right corner of this page. You will see a language selector. Be sure to select the language that matches the package that you downloaded.

        Now that you've downloaded a starter package, you need to unzip it on your hard drive. Doing so will provide you with the default folder structure, scripts and styles needed to complete this tutorial and continue your learning and experimentation afterward. With the folder structure in place, next we'll need to start a web server to serve up your index.html page, so we can view it in a browser. How you go about doing that depends on which server-side technology you want to use. Below are instructions for a couple of common scenarios:

        * **Visual Studio** - Open Visual Studio 2015. Using the main menu, select File > Open > Web site... Choose the starter kit folder. Once the folder opens, right click on index.html and select "View in Browser". This will fire up IISExpress and serve index.html.
        * **NodeJS** - To start up a simple web server in the app folder, first globally install the http-server command with `npm install http-server -g`. (In some environments you many need to use `sudo`). Once that is installed, change directory to the starter kit folder. You can now spin up the server from within the folder with the following command `http-server -o`.
        * **Firefox** - If you don't want to worry about setting up a web server, Firefox is flexible enough to serve the app directly from your hard drive. Simply open the `index.html` file with Firefox.

        Once you've got your web server set up, navigate to the `index.html` page using your favorite browser. If everyting is working correctly, you should see the message "Welcome to Aurelia!" displayed.

        ## The Index.html Page

        If you've followed along this far, you now have everything set up to help you learn Aurelia. Let's start by taking a look at the `index.html` file. This file provides a good template for new Aurelia-based apps.

        Yes, that's it. This is the only HTML page in our application. The head of the document is pretty straight forward: just a style sheet link and some metadata. It's the body that's interesting.

        Let's start with the script tags. First we have _system.js_, our standards-based module loader. It's what loads the Aurelia library as well as your own code. Next we have _config.js_. This contains configuration for the loader. It's generated automatically whenever you install packages with our tools. We've gone ahead and pre-installed everything for you in this tutorial, so you don't need to worry about that yet.

        Once we have our module loader and its configuration, we load the `aurelia-bootstrapper` module with a call to `System.import`.

        When the bootstrapper loads it inspects the HTML document for _aurelia-app_ attributes. In this case it will find that the body has an `aurelia-app` attribute. This tells the bootstrapper to load our _app_ view-model and its view, conventionally located in _app.js_ and _app.html_ and then compose them as an Aurelia application in the DOM.

        Wait a minute....we don't have an _app_ view-model or view. Ummm...WHAT NOW!?

        ## Creating Your First Screen

        In Aurelia, user interface components have two parts: a _view_ and a _view-model_. The _view_ is written with HTML and is rendered into the DOM. The _view-model_ is written with JavaScript/TypeScript and provides data and behavior to the _view_. Aurelia's powerful _databinding_ links the two pieces together allowing changes in your data to be reflected in the _view_ and vice versa. This Separation of Concerns is great for developer/designer collaboration, maintainability, architectural flexibility and even source control.

        Let's see how it works...

        In the _src_ folder find the _app.html_ and _app.js_ files. This is the app component's view and view-model, the files that the bootstrapper is loading. Let's start by replacing the _view-model_ with a simple class to hold a _firstName_ and _lastName_. We'll also add a computed property for _fullName_ and a method to "submit" the person. Here's what your _app.js_ file should look like after you have made the changes:

        Ok. Now that we have a _view-model_ with some basic data and behavior, let's use the following HTML to create the _view_:

      <example title="app.html">
        <source-code lang="HTML">
          <template>

              <h2>${heading}</h2>

    </article>

    <article>
      <narrative uid="5" version="1.0">
        The first thing to notice is that all views are contained within a `template` tag, part of the W3C spec for Web Components. This particular view is a basic input form. Look at the input controls. Did you notice `value.bind="firstName"`? That databinds the input's _value_ to the _firstName_ property in our view-model. Any time the view-model's property changes, the input will be updated with the new value. Any time you change the value in the input control, Aurelia will push the new value into your view-model. It's that easy.

        There are a couple more interesting things in this example. In the last form group you can see this syntax in the HTML content: `${fullName}`. That's a string interpolation. It's a one-way binding from the view-model into the view that is automatically converted to a string and interpolated into the document. Finally, have a look at the form element itself. You should notice this: `submit.trigger="submit()"`. That's an event binding. Whenever the form's _submit_ event is fired the _submit_ method on the view-model will be invoked.

        Let's refresh our browser to see the updated app in action. Pretty cool, yes!?

        > **Note:** The `.bind` command uses the default binding behavior for any property. The default is one-way binding (model to view) for everything except form controls, which default to two-way. You can always override this by using the explicit binding commands `.one-way`, `.two-way` and `.one-time`. Similarly, you can use `.delegate` for event delegation in place of `.trigger`.

        ## Adding Navigation

        A one page app isn't very interesting. We should probably add some more screens and set up a client-side router, don't you think? Let's begin by renaming our _app.js_ and _app.html_ to _welcome.js_ and _welcome.html_ respectively. This will be the first screen of our multi-screen app. Now, lets create a new _app.js_ and _app.html_ which will serve as our "layout",  "master page" or "root component". The view will contain our navigation UI and the content placeholder for the current screen and the view-model will configure a router instance with our routes. We'll start with the view-model so you can see how to set up the router:

        Ok, we want to use the router, so we begin by creating and exporting our _App_ class and having it implement the `configureRouter` callback. This callback will be invoked with a configuration object. Using the configuration object, we set a title to use when generating the document's title, then map our routes. Each route has the following properties:

        * `route`: This is a pattern which, when matched, will cause the router to navigate to this route. You can use static routes like above, but you can also use parameters like this: `customer/:id`. There's also support for wildcard routes and query string parameters. The route can be a single string pattern or an array of patterns as above.
        * `name`: This is a name to use in code when generating URLs for the route.
        * `moduleId`: This is a path which specifies the component you want to render for this route.
        * `title`: You can optionally provide a title to be used in generating the document's title.
        * `nav`: If this route should be included in the _navigation model_ because you want to generate a UI with it, set this to true (or a number indicating order).

        Following our simple app-building convention, the `App` class will be databound to the above view in _app.html_. A large part of this markup deals with setting up the main navigation structure. But before we get into that...do you see the `require` elements at the top of the view? In the same way that you can use `import` statements in ES2015/2016, Aurelia enables you to use `require` elements in HTML. The require element enables loading and including of functionality such as custom elements and behaviors, and in this case, CSS. Here, since our sample app is going to use some bootstrap styles and icons from font-awesome, we "require" those style sheets. With that in place, we can use bootstrap to lay out our navigation structure, as above. But that's not the interesting part of this view. What we really want to focus on is the binding and custom elements...

        Since you've seen basic binding and string interpolation already, let's focus on the new stuff. Take a look at the navbar-nav `ul` element. Its `li` demonstrates how to use a repeater with the following expression `repeat.for="row of router.navigation"`. This will create one `li` for each item in the `router.navigation` array. The local variable is _row_ and you can see that used throughout the `li` and its child elements.

        > **Note:** The `navigation` property on the router is an array populated with all the routes you marked as `nav:true` in your route config. Aurelia models its `repeat.for` syntax after the new standard ES2015 `for..of` loop. So, you can think of looping over the array of navigable routes and generating UI for each.

        Also on the `li` you can see a demonstration of how to use string interpolation to dynamically add/remove classes. Further down in the view, there's a second `ul`. See the binding on its single child `li`? `if.bind="router.isNavigating"` This conditionally adds/removes the `li` based on the value of the bound expression. Conveniently, the router will update its `isNavigating` property whenever it is....navigating.

        The last piece we want to look at is the `router-view` custom element near the bottom of the view. This element, provided by Aurelia, represents the location in the DOM where the current "screen" will be rendered, based on the configured router's state.

        With this in place, go ahead and refresh the browser and have a look. You should now see a main navigation with a single selected tab for our "welcome" route. The _welcome_ view should display in the main content area and function as before. Open up the browser's debug tools and have a look at the live DOM. You will see that the _welcome_ view content is displayed inside the `router-view`.

        There's a lot of cool stuff here. Let's start at the beginning. We are importing `HttpClient` from Aurelia's Fetch plugin, as well as the fetch polyfill. This lets us make HTTP requests in a very simple way, based on the upcoming W3C Fetch standard. This plugin is not included with the default Aurelia configuration but we've included it in this starter kit for you.

        > **Note:** In a later tutorial we'll talk more about the power of the integrated package manager and loader.

        If you are using ES2016, take a look at the `inject` decorator. What does that do? Well, Aurelia creates the UI components as needed to render your app. It does this by using a [Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) container capable of providing constructor dependencies like HttpClient. How does the DI system know what to provide? All you have to do is add that ES2016 `inject` decorator to your class. It should pass a list of types to provide instances of. There should be one argument for each constructor parameter. In the above example, we needed an HttpClient instance, so we added the `HttpClient` type in the `inject` decorator and then added a corresponding parameter in the constructor.

        If you are sticking with ES2015, or don't want to use decorators, you can also add a static `inject` method or property to the class that returns an array of types to inject.

        If you are using TypeScript >= 1.5, you can add the `@autoinject` decorator to your class and leave out the Types in the decorator call, but just use them on the constructor's signature.

        Aurelia's router enforces a lifecycle on view-models whenever routes change. This is referred to as the "Screen Activation Lifecycle" or "Navigation Lifecycle". View-models can optionally hook into various parts of the lifecycle to control flow into and out of the route. When your route is ready to activate the router will call the `activate` hook, if present. In the above code, we use this hook to call the GitHub API and get some users back. Notice that we return the result of the http request back from our `activate` method. All the `HttpClient` APIs return a `Promise`. The router will detect a `Promise` and wait to complete navigation until after it resolves. So, in this way, you can optionally force the router to delay displaying the page until it is populated with data.

        >**Note:** The full navigation lifecycle includes `canActivate`, `activate`, `canDeactivate` and `deactivate` hooks. The can* methods can return a boolean (or Promise of boolean) to accept or reject the transition into or out of the current screen.

        >**Note:** If you aren't familiar with [Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/), these are a new feature of ES2015 designed to improve asynchronous programming. A `Promise` is an object that represents a future result. Essentially, it represents a "promise" to complete some work or to provide some data at some point in the future.

        The view for this screen is pretty straight forward. There's nothing you haven't seen before.

        Once you've got all this in place, go ahead and run your app again. You should now see two items in the nav bar and be able to switch back and forth between them. Huzzah!

        Let's recap. To add a page to your app:

        1. Add the route configuration to the _app.js_ router.
        2. Add a view-model.
        3. Add a view with the same name (but with an .html extension).
        4. Celebrate.
