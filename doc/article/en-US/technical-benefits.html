      ## Modern JavaScript

      * The only framework fully written in standards-based ES 2015 and ES 2016.
      * Forward compatible with JavaScript technology that is 2-3 years in the future.
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="2" version="1.0">
      ## Modern DOM

      * Consistently leverages the most modern DOM APIs.
      * Bare “to the metal” usage of the DOM; no DOM wrappers in order to ensure maximum performance and memory efficiency.
      * Automatically polyfills the DOM where appropriate, in order to support older browsers (IE9).
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="3" version="1.0">
      ## Modern Tooling

      * Designed to work with modern ES 2015-oriented package managers like JSPM.
      * Intended to be used with modern transpilers such as Babel and TypeScript.
      * Supports modern build tooling such as Gulp, out-of-the-box.
      * Works well with powerful testing tools like Karma and Protractor.
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="4" version="1.0">
      ## Code Quality

      * Source code is covered by an extensive suite of unit tests.
      * All source is fully linted for style and feature-usage consistency throughout.
      * Code correctness is independently verified by two transpilers: Babel and TypeScript.
      * TypeScript d.ts files and full API documentation are provided for all libraries.
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="5" version="1.0">
      ## Web Component Standards

      * Leverages standards-compliant Web Components specs such as HTMLTemplateElement and ShadowDOM.
      * Aurelia components can be exported as standards-compliant Web Components for use outside of the framework, in other apps and web pages (soon).
      * Fully compatible with 3rd-party Web Components, even those originating from other frameworks such as Polymer.
      * Shields developers from broken or poorly designed aspects of Web Components.
      * Provides a Web Component-based programming model even on browsers that will never support Web Components (IE).
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="6" version="1.0">
      ## Modularity

      * Highly modular development, suitable for large-scale apps.
      * Native support for feature-based development facilitating parallel development of multiple teams on the same app.
      * Strong component model for high re-use of UI components across apps.
      * Export components as spec-compliant Web Components for use in non-Aurelia apps (soon)
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="7" version="1.0">
      ## Platform Support

      * Designed for modern web browsers.
      * Adds polyfills to support older browsers, such as IE9.
      * A core platform abstraction allows execution of Aurelia in different types of JavaScript environments: browser, NodeJS, Windows Store, etc.
      * Designed for mobile application development in combination with PhoneGap/Cordova/Crosswalk.
      * Designed for desktop application development in combination with Electron or NWJS.
    </narrative>

    <narrative uid="8" version="1.0">
      ## Capabilities

      * Write apps in ES2015/2016/TypeScript.
      * One simple way of creating components that work in a variety of contexts:
          * Custom Elements
          * Dynamically Composed UI (data-driven component composition)
          * Routing/Navigation
          * Modal Dialogs
          * Web Components
          * Progressive Enhancement
          * Custom scenarios enabled through our Composition Engine
      * Fully-extensible View Compiler, View Engine and View Resource Pipeline.
      * Fully-extensible and adaptive data-binding engine.
      * Powerful and flexible hierarchical dependency injection.
      * Eager/Lazy/Hybrid loading of all application resources.
      * Powerful application router with support for encapsulated child routers for multi-team, large-scale development.
      * Optionally create standards-compliant Web Components or leverage “shielding” from the flaws in the WC specs.
      * Interoperate with any standards-compliant Web Component.
      * Loosely coupled cross-component communication via an EventAggregator (Pub/Sub)
      * Fully customizable application startup and plugin model.
      * Enables authoring of testable, maintainable and extensible code.
      * Leverage conventions to write less code and get more done.
      * Little to no framework intrusion, so developers can focus on their app, not the framework.
      * Application and package bundling compatible with any build system.
